# Quality Check for Tide Gauge Measurements in Greenland


## Introduction
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Goal
The goal of this work is to generate an automated QC algorithm which can detect and adapt faulty measurements using ML.

## Motivation
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Roadmap
This project will start off by developing a ML approach to flag tide gauge measurements in adequate groups. The next step will then be to adapt the flagged values to create a 'correct' ts. The timeline for this project is around 10 months.
